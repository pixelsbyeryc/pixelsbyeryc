Hello, I’m Eryc. 👋

I’m a UI Designer & Coder, passionate about learning — especially about how things work, and how people think.

**I’m currently looking for a job in web3 as a UI Designer.** 👨‍💻

In the meantime, I’ve been building [HomeBills](https://github.com/pixelsbyeryc/home-bills), a minimalistic personal finance tracker for people who despise microtransactions.
