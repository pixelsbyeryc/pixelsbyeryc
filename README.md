# âœ–ï¸Ž MAKING THE WEB LESS BORING âœ–ï¸Ž

Hello, my name is Eryc â€” I'm a curious person, passionate about learning, especially about how things work, and how people think. I've been working in marketing and tech for the past 7 years, and just recently started to explore blockchain technologies and their future possibilities.

â˜ž **I can design** layouts with great UX, typography, and layout skills. 

â˜ž **I can also code** HTML, CSS, and some Javascript â€” I prefer vanilla, my favorite ice cream flavor, after pistachio. 

â˜ž And **I'm great at teaching** the concepts I truly understand.
